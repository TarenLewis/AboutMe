        Hi, my name is Taren Lewis.
        \n\nI am interested in Android App development, stock market analysis, and 8-bit style RPG video games and graphics.
        \n\nMy previous semester at Penn State I was the Student team leader for a 5 person group project consisting of a NASDAQ and NYSE Sector and Industry analysis tool.
        \n\nIt had a C++ backend, JS frontend, and was planned to be hosted on an Ubuntu 18.04 Virtual Machine through a droplet on Digital Ocean.
        \n\n\nIn my free time, I like to learn about code, lay around in my hammock, go for bike rides, explore the woods behind my house, or play video games with my friends.
        \n\n\nI have experience with the following technologies:
        \n\n-C++
        \n\n-Java
        \n\n-JS
        \n\n-VHDL
        \n\n
